 [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/stkent/android-libraries/PolygonDrawingUtil/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/stkent/android-libraries/PolygonDrawingUtil/_latestVersion) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-PolygonDrawingUtil-green.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/5597)

An efficient Android utility class for drawing regular polygons on a [`Canvas`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html).

Consumers can specify:

- number of sides (â‰¥ 3);
- center coordinates;
- outer radius (center to vertex);
- corner rounding radius;
- polygon rotation;
- fill/stroke [`Paint`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html).

# Demo

This video was captured using the sample application in this repository. It provides convenient controls for exploring `PolygonDrawingUtil`'s capabilities.

# Getting Started

1. Specify PolygonDrawingUtil as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
      compile 'com.stkent:polygondrawingutil:1.0.0'
    }
    ```

2. Create a new `PolygonDrawingUtil` instance and assign it to a field in your custom view class:

    ```java
    private PolygonDrawingUtil polygonDrawingUtil = new PolygonDrawingUtil();
    ```

3. Call `polygonDrawUtil.drawPolygon` in your `onDraw` method:

    ```java
    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
      super.onDraw(canvas);

      polygonDrawingUtil.drawPolygon(
          canvas,
          numberOfSides,
          centerX,
          centerY,
          polygonRadius,
          cornerRadius,
          rotation,
          polygonPaint);
    }
    ```
